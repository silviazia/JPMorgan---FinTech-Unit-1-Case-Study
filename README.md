## **Domian - Payments**

### **Overview and Origin**

* The son of a successful financier, Junius Spencer Morgan, John Pierpont Morgan (J.P. Morgan), an American financier and industrial organizer, was recognised as one of the world’s leading financial figures during the two pre-World War I decades. 
* His significant contribution in recognizing several major railroads and industrial consolidations, help form the United States (U.S) Steel, International Harvester, and General Electric corporations. 
* J.P. Morgan began his career in 1857 as an accountant with the New York banking firm (Duncan, Sherman, and Company), which was the American representative of the UK based firm George Peabody and Company. 
* In 1861, Morgan became the agent for his father’s banking company in New York City. During 1864–71 he was a member of the firm of Dabney, Morgan and Company, and in 1871 he became a partner in the New York City firm of Drexel, Morgan and Company. 
* Drexel, Morgan and Company soon became the predominant source of U.S. government financing. Hence, in 1895, this firm was named as J.P. Morgan and Company and largely through Morgan’s extraordinary ability, it became one of the most powerful banking houses in the world.
* Morgan had many partners over the years, such as George W. Perkins – an American politician and businessman - but he always remained firmly in charge.
* JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) is a leading global financial services firm with assets of $2.7 trillion and operations worldwide and a front runner in digital innovation.
* In early 2018, the announcement was made that JPMorgan Chase will deploy $1.75 billion in philanthropic capital around the world by 2023.

### **Business Activities**
 
* JPM is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management
* In February 2019, JPM first revealed that they have started their trials of JPM Coin (their own cryptocurrency) last summer. 
* The token was designed to speed transactions, such as payments between firms or bond transactions.
* It was built on [Quorum](https://www.coindesk.com/jpmorgan-ethereum-blockchain-quorum) a private version of Ethereum developed by the bank. However, it was acquired by  ConsenSys (a development firm).
* According to CNBC report, JPM's blockchain-based "Interbank Information Network" is rebranding as **Liink** which will soon launch as a way to validate payments before they are sent. You can learn more about JPM's Liink [Here](https://www.jpmorgan.com/onyx/liink). 
* Umar Farooq, the CEO of Onyx, said, "the bank is also eyeing using blockchain to send digital versions of paper checks and save banks **75%** of the costs currently needed to send and process these payments". 

*Advantages of the technology JPM introduced
 
* Since the lauch of JPM coin in summer 2019, they became the first global bank to design a network that facilitates instantaneous payments using **blockchain technology**. A technology enabling 24/7, business-to-business money movement by unveiling JPM Coin. 
* JPM Coin is a permissioned blockchain that has a shared ledger system serves as a payment rail and deposit account ledger. Using the permissioned shared ledger system, JPM clients can transfer US Dollars held on deposit with JPM.  
  * As JPM coin facilitates real-time value movement, it easily resolves the common hurdles of traditional cross-border payments.

*Mission

* JP Morgan's ongoing mission is to develop cutting edge technology to help their clients to experience better future in the financial system.

### **Landscape**

* As mentioned above, JP Morgan chase & co is a **Bank** or financial institution that dominates globally in investment banking, asset management, private banking, private wealth management, and treasury services divisions.
* Banks face challenges/disruption like every other domain. Over the past 10 years, they have been affected by the global financial crisis (GFC), regulatory reforms, rise of new competitors constantly, and currently they are facing a global pandemic. To outlast the current storm and develop greater resilience for future, banks must become instinctive. 
* Mark Sullivan – a Global Business Leader of ‘Banking and Capital Markets, Genpact’ quoted in Genpact report, "Banks will need to compete with the likes of Amazon on customer experience, while also offering something deeper, be it through relationships and service, boosting businesses and communities, or taking a stand on global issues to engender trust. This is how they will transition from offering financial services to enabling financial betterment".
  * Banks used to be a place where clients value the experience interacting with employees and vice versa. 
  * However, as human knowledge meets artificial intelligence and more machines entering the workforce replacing human emplyees, number of jobs are disappearing and new ones     are created.
* It is expecetd that, harnessing the combination of technological and human power to the best way possible, banks that sustain and thrive in the coming five years will need to be better in every sense. Hence, maintaining the human touch as a key issue, banks can reskill their people to work alongside tech to reach the best possible outcomes.
* JPM is leading the way to harnessing this combination.  
 
*Competitors or Threats

* In today's evolving FinTech environment, Banks are in constant threat to compete with the likes of Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon (GAFA). 
* JPM's major competitors include Citi, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Capital One, Credit Suisse , Fidelity Investments, Wells Fargo, American Express, HSBC.

### **Results**

* Since its debut, JPM coin's foray into the crypto market has been hailed as a game changer, especially when it comes to improving the mainstream perception of the digital asset industry as a whole.
* JP Morgan seems to have finally delivered on its promise of building a solution that could potentially save the global finance industry hundreds of millions of dollars in peripheral costs such as processing charges, high tax fees and more.
* Although JPM is one of the biggest players operating within the global payments landscape, with the firm reportedly facilitating transfers in excess of $6 trillion across more than 100 countries on a daily basis, the move will most likely fail to have any sort of major impact on market. Especially because thier payment network is sealed off from those not fungible with them.
  * However, the move does represent a further step toward the mainstream adoption of crypto and technology, which is ready for real-time, industrialized use.
  * Additionally, according to Paul Brody - principal & global innovation leader, Earnst & Young - the entry of JPM coin helps number of enterprises to reduce cost of running 
    a cross-border business deal significantly by making a part of a fully digital business contracts, for their business to business payments. That is quite remarkable. 
  * The use of the blockchain dramatically reduces the settlement time as well.

 ### **Recommendations**
 
 * JPM is the best amongst the best because they can do it all. They have some of the best mobile banking and finance technology. 
 * As a front runner in digital treasury and payments, JPM has been recognized with multiple **No.1** rankings for cash management, innovation, digital capabilities and quality of advice in **the 2020 Greenwich Associates U.S. Large Corporate Cash Management study, Excellence Awards and Digital Banking Benchmark study**.
 * Their digital-first products also recognised as the best in the business.  
 * However, currently JPM coin is only available for institutional clients, i.e. brokers, dealers, banks etc. It can not be used by anyone or by public like cryptocurrency. Because of this difference, many experts have doubts whether JPM coin is truly a cryptocurrency! They argue that JPM coin could very much be a digital coin. Hence, the bank should plan to offer JPM coin to public as well and soon to stop the disbelief of the experts. Additionally, JPM should improve its presence in the M&A advisory and equity underwriting further in comparison with Goldman Sachs.  
 * But based on my research, I personally belive that, as one of the most trusted and elite investment banks, JP Morgan can be referred to as swiss army knife of banks like McGyver!
