### **Overview and Origin**

•	The son of a successful financier, Junius Spencer Morgan, John Pierpont Morgan (J.P. Morgan), an American financier and industrial organizer, was recognised as one of the world’s leading financial figures during the two pre-World War I decades. 
•	His significant contribution in recognizing several major railroads and industrial consolidations, help form the United States (U.S) Steel, International Harvester, and General Electric corporations. 
•	J.P. Morgan began his career in 1857 as an accountant with the New York banking firm (Duncan, Sherman, and Company), which was the American representative of the UK based firm George Peabody and Company. 
•	In 1861, Morgan became the agent for his father’s banking company in New York City. During 1864–71 he was a member of the firm of Dabney, Morgan and Company, and in 1871 he became a partner in the New York City firm of Drexel, Morgan and Company. 
•	Drexel, Morgan and Company soon became the predominant source of U.S. government financing. Hence, in 1895, this firm was named as J.P. Morgan and Company and largely through Morgan’s extraordinary ability, it became one of the most powerful banking houses in the world.
