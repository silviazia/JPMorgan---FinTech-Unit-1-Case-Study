Over the past 10 years, they have been affected by the global financial crisis (GFC), regulatory reforms, rise of new competitors constantly, and currently they are facing a global pandemic. To outlast the current storm and develop greater resilience for future, banks must become instinctive. 
* Mark Sullivan – a Global Business Leader of ‘Banking and Capital Markets, Genpact’ quoted in Genpact report, "Banks will need to compete with the likes of Amazon on customer experience, while also offering something deeper, be it through relationships and service, boosting businesses and communities, or taking a stand on global issues to engender trust. This is how they will transition from offering financial services to enabling financial betterment".
  * Banks used to be a place where clients value the experience interacting with employees and vice versa. 
  * However, as human knowledge meets artificial intelligence and more machines entering the workforce replacing human emplyees, number of jobs are disappearing and new ones     are created.

* JPM is leading the way to harnessing this combination.
